Each term that appears in the text document is stored in Class Dictionary with term’s name and its document frequency and a linked list that contains variables of Class Posting. Class Posting contains document’s name and term frequency thus each Dictionary class variable is associated with a linked list of documents and term frequencies that contained the term. All the Dictionary Class variables are stored in a linked list named words.\r\nVector Space model takes as input a free text query. Query terms are also tokenized and normalized after which they are stored in a linked list of Class Queryterm. Class Queryterm contains the term name and term frequency of that particular term in the given query.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
